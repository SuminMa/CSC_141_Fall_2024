#2-12. Zen of Python

#enter import this and skim through them

#write what I did and what you learned from this information by using comments in your code
'''
I've learned that Python has a clear philosophy guiding how we should code.
It was a helpful reminder for me to focus on writing clean, efficient, and readable code.
Python emphasizes simplicity and clarity, which not only makes the code easier for others
to understand but also helps prevent errors in the long run. By following these principles,
I can create code that's not only functional but also elegant, making it easier to maintain
and scale as projects grow.
