#3-5. Changing Guest List

#start with exercise 3-4
guest_list = ['Xavier', 'Erica', 'Monica', 'Charlotte']

#add a print() call, stating the name of the guest who can't make it
print(f"Sorry I don't think I can make the dinner, says {guest_list[3]}")
print() #add a new line

#modify my list, replacing the name of the guest who can't make it with the name of the new person I am inviting
guest_list[3] = 'Jeily'

#print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in my list
print(guest_list)
