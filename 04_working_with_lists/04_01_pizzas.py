#4-1. Pizzas

#store these pizza names in a list
pizzas = ['pineapple', 'cheese', 'meat']

#use a for loop to print the name of each pizza
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)

print() #add a new line

#modify my for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(f"I like {pizza} pizza.")

print() #add a new line

#add a line at the end of my program, outside the for loop, that states how much I like pizza
print("I absolutely love all of those!")
