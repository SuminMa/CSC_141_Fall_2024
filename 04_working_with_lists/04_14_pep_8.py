#a small paragraph about what I did and what I learned
'''
I skimmed through the PEP 8 style guide to get a better understanding of
Python's best practices. The guide emphasizes the importance of code
readability and consistency across projects. One key takeaway is the use of
4 spaces for indentation and the suggestion to limit line length to
79 characters, ensuring that code remains clean and easy to read.
I also learned about the importance of organizing imports, using consistent
naming conventions, and adding comments where necessary. Though I might not
be able to use all of these guidelines immediately, they will be valuable as
my coding projects grow more complex.
