# Make sure they follow the styling guidelines described in this section.
'''
- Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should use
lowercase letters and underscores.

- Module names should use these conventions as well.

- Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what the function does.

- If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used
on either side of the equal sign.

- The same convention should be used for keyword arguments in function calls.

- If a set of parameters causes a functionâ€™s definition to be longer than
79 characters, press ENTER after the opening parenthesis on the definition line.
On the next line, press the TAB key twice to separate
the list of arguments from the body of the function, which will only be
indented one level.

- If your program or module has more than one function, you can separate each by
two blank lines to make it easier to see where one function ends and the next one begins.

- All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file.
The only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to
describe the overall program.
