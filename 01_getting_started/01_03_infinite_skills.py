#1-3. Infinite Skills
'''
Reflecting on my previous programming experiences, I believe they will help me debug errors in this class until they’re resolved.
I've spent long hours sitting in one place, fixing errors, and eventually succeeding.
I've come to appreciate the persistence and patience that those efforts have taught me, and I value the lessons they’ve provided.

If I had infinite programming skills, I’d love to contribute to the development of spacecraft that could bring our sci-fi dreams to life.
Imagine being part of a team that builds the technology to explore new worlds and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
That’s the kind of future I’d like to help create.
